Patient Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS):

Patients will be asked to report pain scores at each visit. Patients will report scores on a scale of 0 to 10.

0 signifies no pain and 10 signifies the worst pain imaginable. Higher scores indicate increased levels of pain., Baseline and up to Week 28|Absolute Change in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Absolute Change at week 28 from baseline in DLQI.

The DLQI is a validated questionnaire consisting of 10 questions that has been used in many randomized controlled trials in dermatology.

Scoring of each question is as follows:

Very much - 3 A lot - 2 A little - 1 Not at all - 0 Not relevant - 0 Question unanswered - 0

The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question with total scale from 0-30. Higher score represents a quality of life that is more impaired.

Definition of DLQI Scores 0-1 = no effect at all on patient's life 2-5 = small effect on patient's life 6-10 = moderate effect on patient's life 11-20 = very large effect on patient's life 21-30 = extremely large effect on patient's life

A change in DLQI score of at least 4 points is considered clinically important. Such change suggests that there has actually been a meaningful change in that patient's quality of life since the previous measurement of his/her/their DLQI scores., Baseline and up to Week 28|Recurrence of PG lesions (GPG >0) after achieving complete re-epithelialization (GPG score 0) and spesolimab cessation, GPG Severity Score Scale:

CR or PR in Part 2 of this study requires confirmation of the next response at ≥4 weeks., From the date of screening until the last observation visit (up to 50 months)|Part 1 and Part 2: Overall response rate (ORR), ORR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of CR or PR., From the date of screening until the last observation visit (up to 50 months)|Part 1 and Part 2: Disease control rate (DCR), DCR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of CR, PR, or SD., From the date of screening until the last observation visit (up to 50 months)|Part 1 and Part 2: Clinical benefit rate (CBR), CBR is defined as the percentage of participants with BOR of CR, PR or durable (SD) (duration of SD ≥ 23 weeks)., From the date of screening until the last observation visit (up to 50 months)|Part 2: Duration of Response (DOR), DOR is defined as the time from the first documentation of CR or PR to the first documented date of event (disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first)., From the date of screening until the last observation visit (up to 50 months)|Part 2: Progression-free survival (PFS), PFS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of study drug to the first documented date of event (disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurs first)., From the date of screening until disease progression or death (up to 50 months)|Part 2: Overall Survival (OS), OS is defined as the time from the date of the first dose to the date of death from any cause. For participants who are alive or unknown, OS is censored as the date of the last known alive date or the date of data cut off, whichever comes first., From the date of screening until the last observation visit (up to 50 months)",Eisai Inc.,PHASE1,82,INTERVENTIONAL,Allocation: NA|Intervention Model: SINGLE_GROUP|Masking: NONE|Primary Purpose: TREATMENT,2017-11-28,2022-10-26,"Eisai Trial Site 5, Matsuyama, Ehime, Japan|Eisai Trial Site 6, Kurume, Fukuoka, Japan|Eisai Trial Site 8, Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan|Eisai Trial Site 4, Akashi, Hyōgo, Japan|Eisai Trial Site 7, Niigata, Niigata, Japan|Eisai Trial Site 3, Hidaka, Saitama, Japan|Eisai Trial Site 9, Sunto-gun, Shizuoka, Japan|Eisai Trial Site 1, Chuo-ku, Tokyo, Japan|Eisai Trial Site 10, Koto-Ku, Tokyo, Japan|Eisai Trial Site 2, Koto-ku, Tokyo, Japan"

Wound surface area is measured using length × width, captured at the point of care using structured fields within the electronic health record (EHR) or electronic data capture (EDC) system. Values are recorded in cm² and used to calculate PSAR as:

\[(Baseline area - Follow-up area) ÷ Baseline area\] × 100

This metric is assessed at multiple time intervals, including 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. PSAR is a key performance indicator for healing trajectory and is used to evaluate response to interventions. All wound types are included, and multiple wounds per patient are analyzed independently. Surface area measurements are case-mix adjusted using the Wound Healing Index for comparative effectiveness and quality reporting., variable - measured at multiple intervals (e.g., 4, 12, 16, 24, and 52 weeks)",U.S. Wound Registry,,300000,OBSERVATIONAL,Observational Model: |Time Perspective: p,2005-01-01,2030-01,"US Wound Registry, The Woodlands, Texas, 77386, United States"
